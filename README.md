# Voice Controlled Device

## Project Overview
The Voice Controlled Device was developed as a graduation project during an associate degree program at Istanbul Ayvansaray University. This project aimed to create a hands-free solution for controlling everyday tasks such as TV operations, music playback, and voice note-taking through voice commands. The system was complemented by a mobile application for seamless interaction.
